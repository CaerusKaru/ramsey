<p>Let there be n<sub>7</sub> degree 7 vertices, and n<sub>8</sub> degree 8 vertices.</p>
<p>We show that n<sub>7</sub> = 2s.</p>
<p>Since every edge is degree 7 or 8, the only way to have 140 edges is to have all vertices of degree 8.</p>
<p>If G has fewer than 140 edges, some of these edges must be missing, and every missing edge is incident to two
  vertices, so n<sub>7</sub> = 2s.</p>
