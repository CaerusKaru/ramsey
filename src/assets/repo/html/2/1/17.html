<p>For any vertex v in G, G<sub>v</sub> is a (3,8;26,76) graph.</p>
<p>Using neighborhood gluing, the authors reconstruct every (3,9;35;140) graph from each (3,8;26,76) graph
  (found using mtf method), and show that all constructed graphs are isomorphic.</p>
<p>Therefore, there is a unique (up to isomorphism), 8-regular (3,9;35) graph, and it contains 140 edges.</p>
