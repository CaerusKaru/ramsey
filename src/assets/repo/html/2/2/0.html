<h3>Theorem 4: R(3,10) = 43 if and only if e(3,10,42)=189.</h3>

<p>An equivalent statement of this theorem is: if G is a (3,10;42) graph, then G has 189 edges.</p>
<p>The authors prove the theorem by showing that any such G must be regular degree 9.</p>
<p>Since (9 &times; 42)/2 = 189, G must have 189 edges.</p>
