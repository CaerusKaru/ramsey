<p><b>Case 5: n<sub>7</sub> >2.</b></p>
<p>Given the above cases, it must be that n<sub>7</sub> = 3, n<sub>8</sub> = 2, for s = 4 and e = 185.</p>
<p>In this case, there is a vertex v of degree 7 connected to at most one other vertex of degree 7, so
  Z(v) &ge; 7 + 2 &times; 8 + 4 &times; 9 > 60 - s.</p>
<p>This contradicts the value of Z(v) derived above.</p>
