<p>In constructing these graphs, G&amp;R relied on several algorithms. The two main algorithms they use are the maximal
  triangle free method (mtf) and the neighborhood gluing method. We have provided a demo of the maximal triangle free
  method to illustrate how the algorithm works. The neighborhood gluing method is, unfortunately, too complicated for a
  demo, but a specialized version of it is described in the proof of theorem 6.
