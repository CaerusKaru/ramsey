<p>G&amp;R then show that if R(3,10) = 43, then there is a size 42 graph H that lacks a 3 clique and lacks a 10 clique
  in its complement, and that this graph is 9-regular (theorem 4). This solution leverages the theorem proved above to
  reduce the number of graphs that need to be considered. Given this large amount of structure in these graphs, G&amp;R
  are able to reduce the number of possible subgraphs that compose H. Basically, they are able to infer what kind of
  graph would result if they removed and vertex and its neighbors from H, then attempt to reconstruct H from these
  smaller graphs. Since they fail in reconstructing H from all such smaller graphs, they conclude that no such H exists
  (theorem 6). Therefore, R(3,10) < 43.
