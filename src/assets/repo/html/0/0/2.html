<p>Here, we are concerned with a particular set of Ramsey numbers: those for R(3,k) where k is arbitrary. Erdos spent
  much of his career analyzing the asymptotics of R(3,k), and in 1961 discovered the lower bound
  R(3,k) = &Omega;((k / ln k)<sup>2</sup> using the probabalistic method. It took until 1995 to prove the corresponding
  upper bound, which was discovered by Jeong-Han Kim. However, we are not here concerned with the general asymptotics of
  R(3,k), but rather the derivation of an upper bound on one of its instances.
