<p>In 1935, Paul Erdos and George Szekeres discovered that graphs of a certain size were guaranteed to exhibit a certain
  amount of structure. Specifically, they discovered that for any size clique, all graphs over a certain size are
  guaranteed to either contain the clique, or contain the clique in their complement. This discovery had, in fact, been
  made independently several years before in 1927 by Frank Ramsey, though his result addressed a problem in logic and
  had not been applied to graphs. Today, we know this area of research as Ramsey theory.</p>
