<p>The theorem described above pertains to cliques of a single size, but the problem can be made more general. For
  example, given a clique of size j and a clique of size k, every graph over some size n is guaranteed to either contain
  a j-clique or contain a k-clique in its complement. In this case, we say that R(j,k) &le; n. If n happens to be the
  smallest number of vertices for which this holds, we say that R(j,k) = n.
