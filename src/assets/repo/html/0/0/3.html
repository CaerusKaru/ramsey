<p>R(3,k) is known for 0 &le; k &le 9, but R(3,10) remains a mystery. It has been shown that 40 &le; R(3,10) &le;42, and
  this page is devoted to presenting the proof of the upper bound, which was published by Jan Geodgebeur and Stanislaw
  P. Radziszowski (G&amp;R) in 2013. The lower bound, which we do not address here, was discovered by Geoffrey Exoo in
  1989 using a simulated annealing algorithm. </p>
