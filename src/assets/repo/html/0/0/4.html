<p>We lay out the general proof technique used to derive the upper bound of 42. G&amp;R first prove that any size 35
  graph G that lacks either a 3-clique or a 9-clique in the complement is 8-regular, and that G is isomorphic to any
  other graphs with the same characteristics (theorem 3). (A graph is m-regular if every vertex in the graph is adjacent
  to m other vertices.) This result is helpful because, in attempting to construct larger graphs, only one graph of this
  type needs to be considered. </p>
