# Ramsey

This project was a collaboration between David Stalfa and Adam Plumer for COMP 150-ADG at Tufts University

### Description

This repository is for a web frontend written in Angular v4 to break down research on the upper bound
for the [Ramsey number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramsey%27s_theorem#Ramsey_numbers) R(3, 10).

The website contains a detailed walkthrough of the latest research and the theorems that support this research,
with detailed visuals and analysis. The website also contains links to the research and a presentation given
for the class. Finally, the website contains some animated examples of the methods and algorithms used in finding
the upper bound for R(3, 10), like the Maximal Triangle Free (MTF) method.
